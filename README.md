# Salinlahi: A Filipino Genealogy App (CLI Version)

**Salinlahi** is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application written in Python for building a family history tree tailored for Filipino users. It allows you to input and manage basic genealogical data such as names, birthdates, and parents, and stores this data in a JSON file.

## Features

- Add a person's name, birthdate, and parent names
- Search for a person by first and/or last name
- Delete a person's record
- Save all entries in a JSON file
- Flexible birthdate entry: supports full date, month-year, year only, or unknown

## File Structure

- `main.py` â€“ Entry point for the CLI application
- `create_person.py` â€“ Handles creating, saving, deleting, and searching for a person
- `familytree.py` â€“ Defines the FamilyTree class structure
- `tree_image.py` â€“ Contains an ASCII image for app branding
- `family_data.json` â€“ JSON file where all data is stored (created after first save)

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. In your terminal or command prompt, run:

   ```bash
   python main.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to:

Add a new person
